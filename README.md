## Human Environment Protection Software

Welcome to my Github project where I showcase my work on building and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using Tensorflow for detecting fire hazards, people, and objects in real-time scenarios. My interactive web application empowers users to experience the power of CNNs and their capabilities in detecting fire hazards. Whether you are a fire safety inspector, firefighter, or just interested in fire safety, this application can help you detect potential fire hazards quickly and accurately. The models I have built are based on deep learning algorithms that have been trained on a large dataset to detect and classify fire hazards, people, and objects. Join me in exploring the world of CNNs and their vast potential in making our environment safer.
